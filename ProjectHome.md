Otter is an open-source basic knowledge base and wiki, designed to be quick-to-deploy and simple-to-maintain for environments using Microsoft technologies such as .Net and SQL Server.

For corporate environments already invested in, and comfortable with, traditional open source application stacks (Linux, PHP, MySQL, etc.), there are a variety of great open source wiki and knowledge base solutions to deploy. However, in environments that are invested primary in Microsoft technologies (Windows Server, IIS, ASP.Net, SQL Server), there are far fewer viable options. SharePoint is a robust solution but comes shackled with extraordinary deployment and maintenance overhead.

Otter is intended to be a very easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use, and easy-to-maintain knowledge base solution for environments that are already invested in Microsoft technology solutions. It is not intended to be full-featured, but do one thing well: to provide the means to quickly enter and find documentation. (OK, that's two things.)

Some of its main features:

  * Otter uses technologies you most likely already have deployed and support: Microsoft SQL Server, IIS, ASP.Net MVC, and Active Directory.
  * Articles are edited using simple Markdown syntax.
  * Articles can be assigned arbitrary "tags" for logical grouping.
  * History is maintained for all changes to articles. You can always see when and by whom any change was made, compare revisions, and view previous revisions. (Similar to code version control systems, for those familiar with such tools.)
  * Security is based on Active Directory, with read or write permissions that can be assigned to any combination of individual users or groups for each article independently.
